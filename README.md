# Mutation – Wild Type Comparator

A lightweight application for **comparing Wild-Type (WT) and Mutant (MUT) gene / structure data**, designed to help researchers and developers quickly inspect mutation-driven differences in a clear and practical way.

This repository provides a **compiled, ready-to-run version** of the application that can be hosted locally or on a private server.

---

## Overview

Analyzing differences between wild-type and mutant genes or structures is a common but often repetitive task. This tool focuses on **direct comparison**, allowing users to observe mutation-induced changes without setting up complex pipelines.

The application is intended as a **research utility and foundation**, with upcoming extensions aimed at deeper structural and stability analysis.

---

## Current Features

* Wild-Type vs Mutant comparison workflow
* Clear identification of mutation-driven differences
* Simple interface suitable for local or internal use
* Can be deployed on:

  * Localhost
  * Private/internal servers

---

## Installation & Usage

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Host the files using any local or server-based static hosting method
3. Open the application in a browser
4. Load WT and MUT inputs and begin comparison

No additional dependencies or build steps are required.

---

## Use Cases

* Mutation comparison and inspection
* Bioinformatics research workflows
* Educational demonstrations
* Rapid validation of mutation effects before deeper analysis

---

## Planned Features (Next Update)

**Hydrogen Bond Analysis**

* Identification of hydrogen bonds in both WT and MUT structures
* Detection of hydrogen bonds broken or formed due to mutation
* Useful for protein stability and functional impact assessment

Additional analytical features will be added incrementally.

---

## Limitations

* Source code is not included in this version
* Advanced structural metrics are not yet implemented
* Intended for research and evaluation use

---

## Feedback & Collaboration

If you are interested in:

* Custom feature development
* Workflow-specific adaptations
* Collaboration or integration into internal systems
